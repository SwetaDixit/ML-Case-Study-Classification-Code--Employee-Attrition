# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using Python. Employee attrition, or turnover, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company. Understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition is crucial for HR professionals and business leaders to devise effective retention strategies and maintain a stable workforce.

## Description

In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing information about employees, including various attributes such as age, gender, job role, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, and whether they have left the company or not. The objective is to identify patterns and factors that may influence employee attrition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

- **EmployeeID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Age**: Age of the employee.
- **Gender**: Gender of the employee.
- **JobRole**: Role or position of the employee in the company.
- **Department**: Department in which the employee works.
- **EducationField**: Field of education of the employee.
- **YearsAtCompany**: Number of years the employee has been with the company.
- **YearsSinceLastPromotion**: Number of years since the employee's last promotion.
- **YearsWithCurrManager**: Number of years the employee has been with the current manager.
- **Attrition**: Binary variable indicating whether the employee has left the company (Yes) or not (No).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of different variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to visualize the relationships between different variables and identify potential patterns or trends related to employee attrition.
4. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that may have a significant impact on employee attrition.
5. **Model Building**: Build machine learning models to predict employee attrition based on selected features. Experiment with different algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Insights and Recommendations**: Interpret the results of the analysis to provide insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and suggest actionable recommendations for improving employee retention.

## Requirements
